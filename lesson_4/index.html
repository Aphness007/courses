                <h2 id="what_is_bem" class="main__sub_title title">What is BEM?</h2>
                <p class="text">BEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes. The Block,
                    Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for class names in HTML and CSS. It
                    helps to write clean CSS by following some simple rules.</p>
                <p class="text">Projects of any size with CSS can benefit from a <span>BEM</span> frameworkâ€”unless
                    writing styles directly inside already organized JavaScript files and using Styled Components or
                    something similar.
                    To complement <span>BEM</span>, include some parts of SMACSS which act as a style guide for naming
                    conventions.
                    <span>BEM</span> is easy to read and organizes styles, even when projects are extremely
                    large.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Class naming has never been an easy part of CSS. It&aposs challenging for outside
                    developers
                    to
                    understand what developer-specified classes do. Naming conventions can quickly get out of control
                    when refactoring code more than once and when working with a team.</p>
                <h3>Some of the most irritating problems related to naming in CSS when:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="li">Overriding classes accidentally.</li>
                    <li class="li">Hard to read both CSS and HTML has no clear scoping and structure in naming.</li>
                    <li class="li">New team members waste time learning about or trying to find already created classes.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li">The code is hard to update because it&#39;s not clear what aspects are global and
                        what belongs
                        to the local component.</li>
                    <li class="li">It&#39;s unclear how to handle nesting (i.e., what to add or keep?).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text last-p">Most problems come from poor naming and lack of scope (aka the scope that closes
                    the
                    context). For example, when reading the code of the menu developers should feel confident that the
                    code does not include any styles of the headings. In this article, I&#39;ll go over what BEM is, how
                    it works, and recommendations on how to implement <span>BEM</span> successfully.</p>

                <h3>There are three main parts of BEM.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Block which holds everything (elements) inside and acts as a scope.</li>
                    <li>Element which acts as a specific part of the component.</li>
                    <li>Modifier which adds additional styles to a specific element(s).</li>
