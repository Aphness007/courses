        <h1>How the World Wide Web <mark>(WWW)</mark> works</h1>
        <p>Twenty or thirty years ago, there was something you could take for granted: you could walk into a
            public library, open up a reference book, and find information on almost any subject you wanted.
            What we take for granted nowadays is that we can sit down at practically any computer, almost
            anywhere on the planet, and access an online information library far more powerful than any public
            library on Earth: the World Wide Web. <br>Twenty-first century life is so dependent on the Web that
            it
            seems remarkable we ever lived without it. Yet the Web was invented less than 30 years ago and has
            been a huge popular success for only about 20 of them. One of the greatest inventions of all time...
            is also one of the newest!</p>

        <h2>What's the difference between the Web and the Internet?</h2>
        <p>Let's get one thing straight before we go any further: the Web and the Internet are two totally
            different things:<br>
            The Internet is a worldwide network of computers, linked mostly by telephone lines; the Web is just
            one of many things (called applications) that can run on the Internet. When you send an email,
            you're using the Internet: the Net sends the words you write over telephone lines to your friends.
            When you chat to someone online, you're most likely using the Internet too—because it's the Net that
            swaps your messages back and forth. But when you update a blog or Google for information to help you
            write a report, you're using the Web over the Net. You can read more in our article about how the
            Internet works.<br>
            <span>The Web</span> is the worldwide collection of text pages, digital photographs, music files, videos,
            and
            animations you can access over the Internet. What makes the Web so special (and, indeed, gives it
            its name) is the way all this information is connected together. The basic building blocks of the
            Web are pages of text, like this one—Web pages as we call them. A collection of Web pages on the
            same computer is called a website. Every web page (including this one) has highlighted phrases
            called links (or hypertext links) all over it. Clicking one of these takes you to another page on
            this website or another website entirely. So far, so simple.
